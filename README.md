# sic-cospousal-relations
A RimWorld mod to address some shortfalls in Ideology's implementation of polygamy.

Adds an implied relationship between people in marriage to the same person, which removes the mood penalty for sharing a bed so long as their mutual spouse is present. 
Also allows Co-Spoouses to share a bed even with the "Spouse Only: Strict" Physical Love precept from Ideology activated, and adds a slightly boosted chance to explore their own romantic potential.

Tested with Polyamory Beds Vanilla Edition, Royalty and Ideology.

Simply place in Rimworld Mods folder to install. Requires Harmony and Ideology.
